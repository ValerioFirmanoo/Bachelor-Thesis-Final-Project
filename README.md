# Bachelor-Thesis-Final-Project
Data Analysis and Modelling from scratch of Biophysical phenomena (cellular dynamics) with data from Milan University laboratories.

The project lasted several months with several attempts at analysis and models following one another, which is why there is no single notebook that encapsulates all the work done.

The conclusions we arrived at are reposted in the file Thesis.pdf
