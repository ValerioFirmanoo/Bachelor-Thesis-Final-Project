DATA FILTERS

wholeCC=1 	only whole cell cycles are included, i.e. both birth and division were observed
symmDivTolP=[0.4,0.6] 	tolerance range for symmetric division, here each daughter's area should be 40-60% of the parental area
shiftManual=M9S,M9F 	only replicates with a shift from M9-slow to M9-fast media were included
expfitBV2=[0.00,0.07] 	volume growth rate calculated as a single exponential over the entire cell cycle is limited between 0 and 0.07 min{-1} (9.9-Inf min doubling time)


SMOOTHING FILTERS

area=expfitA%s4_0  	area smoothed in lineage data by a single exponential using a 5-point sliding window
L=expfitA%s4_0 	length smoothed in lineage data by a single exponential using a 5-point sliding window
